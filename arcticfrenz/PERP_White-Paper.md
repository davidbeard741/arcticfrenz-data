# PerpeTraders (PERP) Whitepaper

### Token Description

PerpeTraders ( $PERP ) is a unique token on the Solana blockchain. It is multifaceted, serving simultaneously as a stablecoin, security token, utility token, and tokenized stock. This exclusive token is notable for its limited maximum supply of only 100, and it maintains precision to two decimal places. Launched in early 2022, PerpeTraders has established a strong market presence through its stable liquidity pool, making it a seasoned player in its field. Initially created for the legacy community-maintained Solana token registry, which has since reached its End of Life, it is an OG in the Solana token ecosystem.

### Benefits and Considerations

The Solana token, PerpeTraders ( denoted as $PERP ), has a fixed supply of 100 and includes two decimal places for precision. A substantial portion of these tokens are paired with SOL in a liquidity pool, and a majority of the liquidity tokens are locked. Here are several key benefits and considerations of this setup:

1. Being created prior to the adoption of the Metaplex Token Standard in June 2022 and opting not to transition to the new Solana system, the token avoids adopting features that might allow for changes in supply. The original design of $PERP included a hard cap on token supply, and staying on the legacy system ensures adherence to this initial design and economic model.

2. Scarcity and value preservation: A fixed supply of only 100 tokens, with 2 decimals for granularity, inherently limits the number of tokens available. This scarcity can lead to a higher value per token, assuming there is sufficient demand. Scarcity is often used as a mechanism to preserve or increase value over time.

3. Price stability with liquidity pool: Having a large portion of the tokens (69.17 out of 100) in a liquidity pool paired with a stable and popular cryptocurrency like SOL can provide more liquidity and potentially more stability to the token's price. This is because the pool facilitates easier trading and exchange, allowing for smoother price discovery.

4. Locking liquidity tokens: Locking 50 of the liquidity tokens can be seen as a commitment to the token's stability and longevity. It prevents these tokens from being suddenly withdrawn, which could otherwise destabilize the liquidity pool and, by extension, the token's price. This lock-up can instill confidence in potential owners about the seriousness and long-term perspective of the token.

5. Limited inflation risk: With a fixed supply, there is no risk of inflation due to the creation of new tokens. This is attractive to owners who are concerned about the dilution of value.

6. Potential for high liquidity: Given the limited supply and a significant portion of it being in a liquidity pool, these tokens might have high liquidity, making it easier for holders to buy or sell without causing major price fluctuations.

7. Speculative interest: Due to the limited supply and locked liquidity, these tokens might attract speculative interest. Traders might see an opportunity for significant price movements, given the right market conditions.

8. Community and exclusivity: A small total supply can foster a sense of exclusivity and community among holders, which can be beneficial for building a dedicated user base or for certain types of Frenz that benefit from having a smaller, more engaged group of participants.

### Security

âœ… NO | Mintable: Mint function enables contract owner to issue more tokens and cause the coin price to plummet. It is extremely risky. However if ownership is renounced, or is changed to a burn address, this function will be disabled.

âœ… YES | Ownership Renounced: If token ownership is renounced, no one can execute functions such as mint more tokens.

### Disclaimer 

It's important to note that while these features offer benefits, they also come with risks. For example, a very limited supply can lead to price volatility if sudden demand changes occur, and the locking of liquidity tokens, while stabilizing in the short term, might lead to concerns about what happens when the lock period ends. As with any investment, potential token holders should conduct thorough due diligence and consider both the opportunities and risks involved.
